=== What is this? ===

LimbicGL is a little experiment to test various multi-threading strategies for
OpenGL on iOS. 

It also includes my performancemonitor which helped a lot in performance
optimizing Limbic Software's games Nuts! and Zombie Gunship.

=== How to use ===

Open the project in XCode. It should run out of the box.

Check out ./limbicgl/config.h for some configuration values.

You can trigger a GameCenter login by double-tapping the screen.

In order to use the GameCenter stuff, you may have to fiddle with the bundle
identifier, etc, as it's currently set to com.limbic.limbicgl. You'll have to
set it to a valid bundle identifier you've set up in iTunes connect.

=== Note ===

Please let me know if you find any issues, and feel free to submit any patches
or pull requests!
